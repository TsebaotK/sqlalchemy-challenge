# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this assignment I used the the provided Jupyter notebook and Python file to 
do a Basic climate analysis and data exploration of the provided climate database.

Using the Jupyter file I wrote a script to
-	Create a data frame setting the date column as the index.
-	Sort the data frame by date. 
-	Plot the result from the data frame using pandas plotting.
-	Calculate the summary statistics for the precipitation data.
-	Plot a histogram of the previous 12 months of temperature observation data. 

Using the Python file, I wrote a script to
-	Setup flask 
-	List all the available routes.
-	Return the JSON representation of the precipitation dictionary of the last 12 months of data.
-	Return the JSON list of stations from the dataset.
-	Return the JSON list of temperature observations for the previous year.
-	Return the JSON list of the minimum, average and maximum temperature for a specified start or start-end range.
